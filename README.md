# Jupiter's Community Validated Token List (BETA)

A key part of our JUP Promise (Best Price, Best Token Selection, Best UX) is the idea that users should be able to trade any token they want on Jupiter, while having the peace of mind that the token they are trading is the right one.

To create a safer and more transparent trading experience while maintaining open access, we designed token lists with "Strict" and "All" options. The validated token list here is built up together with partners and community, feed Jupiter's "Strict" API, and is in use by some ecosystem partners. [See API Docs.](https://docs.jup.ag/api/token-list-api) 

Our design principles are: Safety, Openness, Unopinionated, Collaborative, Community-Driven. [Learn more about our approach](https://blog.jup.ag/token-list-api/).


## Contribute:

### If you are a project with a new token:
- Open a PR like this [sample PR](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/pull/24)
- Fill up [the markdown template](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/blob/main/pull_request_template.md) in your PR description. It should be populated automatically when you open the PR with you change. Your PR should point to `staging`.
- The PRs will not be reviewed by our community until your project is known. Please drop your PR link in our #token-validation discord channel, introduce your project, and get them to help validate you.
- Your PR will be closed if it does not follow instructions.

### If you are a community member: 
- Support the projects you want to see on the list by upvoting their PRs and helping to validate.
- To validate, leave a comment on the PR like [this example](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/pull/24#pullrequestreview-1294727250). The approval process is held jointly by the team and moderators right now, but your contribution can help to speed up the process. Over time, we would like to open it up to community members in a council.

### Mechanics (Early, Work in Progress):
- After community validation and approval, PRs will be merged to `staging` branch. 
- Tokens will be live when the PRs are merged to `main`. 
- There is no timeline on this right now, and we prefer to be cautious while the process is still early. We ask for your patience as we work on this together and improve the process.
