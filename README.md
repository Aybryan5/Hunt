# Jupiter's Community Validated Token List (BETA)

A key part of our JUP Promise (Best Price, Best Token Selection, Best UX) is the idea that users should be able to trade any token they want on Jupiter, while having the peace of mind that the token they are trading is the right one.

To create a safer and more transparent trading experience while maintaining open access, we designed token lists with "Strict" and "All" options. The validated token list here is built up together with partners and community, feed Jupiter's "Strict" API, and is in use by ecosystem partners. 

Our design principles are: Safety, Openness, Unopinionated, Collaborative, Community-Driven.

## Community-Driven Validation into 'Strict' List:
 The 'Strict' list approach helps to keep our community safe from fake tokens while allowing open access to all projects in the 'All' list. Validation is prioritized by the community -- the more you can show them that you are legit, the faster and easier it is for them to support you. This could include:
 - Support from known accounts on your attestation tweet: [Example](https://twitter.com/Cogent_Crypto/status/1630963084037869569?s=20) 
- Attestation from known developers on your validation PR: [Example](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/pull/76)
-  Support from your community in Jupiter's [#community-validation discord channel](https://discord.gg/jup)

  Reminder: Tokens that meet minimum liquidity criteria will always be available for trading on the 'All' list even without immediate validation.
## Open a PR to Request Validation:
- Open a PR like this [sample PR](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/pull/76) with your addition in the validated-tokens file.
- Fill up [the markdown template](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/blob/main/pull_request_template.md) in your PR description. It will be populated automatically in the draft description when you open the PR. Your PR should point to `staging`. 
- PRs are reviewed in a batch every week and your PR will be closed if there is insufficient community support. See [Community Driven Validation](#community-driven-validation-into-strict-list).

## Community Support: 
- Support the projects you want to see on the list by supporting their tweets and helping to review their PR.
- To validate, leave a comment on the PR like those in [this example](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list/pull/76). The approval process is held jointly by the team and moderators right now, but attestation from known accounts will show support and speed up the process. Over time, we would like to open it up to community members in a council.
